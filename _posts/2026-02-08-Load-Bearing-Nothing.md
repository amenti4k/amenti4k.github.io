There's a concept in structural engineering called "parasitic load" — the weight of a building that exists only to support the building itself. The beams that hold up the beams. The floors that exist so you can place columns on them to hold up other floors. In a well-designed structure the parasitic load is maybe fifteen percent. In a badly designed one, the building is mostly holding itself up, with a thin usable skin stretched over an armature of self-referential support. Nobody designs parasitic load on purpose. It accretes. Layer by layer, constraint by constraint, because steel bends and concrete cracks and gravity doesn't negotiate. The engineers who designed those redundant beams weren't stupid. They were solving a genuine problem with the best tools available. And for a long time, that's exactly how I understood the white-collar economy. The approvals that exist to authorize other approvals. The reconciliations that reconcile the reconciliations. The coordination layers whose only function is to manage the complexity created by having coordination layers. It looked parasitic, sure, but it was necessarily parasitic, because no single person could hold the full context of an operation in their head. We needed the handoffs, the sign-offs, the elaborate workflows, because human cognition has a carrying capacity and the work exceeded it. We built SaaS companies to manage the load, consulting firms to audit it, analytics teams to measure it, and entire MBA programs to teach people to preside over it with the quiet confidence of someone who has never questioned whether the beams are actually holding anything up. The conventional wisdom was that this complexity was structural. The cost of doing business. The weight of the building.

It isn't. I've built the systems that prove it isn't. Orchestration layers, autonomous agents, the things people write breathless LinkedIn posts about. The first time I watched one consume an entire operational workflow I expected it to do the work faster. Approval chains, exception handling for exception handling, a shared spreadsheet that three people understood and two of them had quit. The agent didn't do it faster. It did something worse: it skipped most of it. Not because it was cutting corners but because the corners didn't need to exist. The reconciliations were reconciling discrepancies created by the handoff process itself. The approvals were authorizing work that only required authorization because it had been divided across people who couldn't see each other's context. The parasitic load wasn't supporting the operation. It was supporting the fact that humans were running the operation. Remove the cognitive bottleneck and the load-bearing walls turn out to be vestigial. The second time I watched it happen, different industry, different workflow, same revelation, it was faster. I'd already learned which walls were decorative. The third time, faster still. And this is the part that gets politely applauded at enterprise AI conferences and then quietly ignored in the parking lot afterward: the value of making that parasitic load disappear does not accrue to whoever sells the tool that strips it out. The tool is commodity. Some other team running the same model with a different pitch deck undercuts you by Wednesday. The value accrues to whoever owns the operation that was buried underneath all along. The vendor captures a licensing fee. The owner captures every pound of weight the building no longer needs to carry. And the weight, man. The weight is enormous. Operations running on margins that would embarrass a lemonade stand, not because the businesses are bad but because the businesses have been spending most of their energy holding themselves up.

What I keep circling back to though, what makes this more than a cost-cutting story with better PR, is what happens when you start stripping parasitic load across multiple structures and the learning compounds. Each operation you strip teaches you something about why operations carry unnecessary weight in the first place. The patterns rhyme. The failure modes repeat. The second building is easier than the first. The tenth is dramatically easier than the third. If the intelligence gained from redesigning one structure flows into every subsequent one, if every decorative wall you identify in one place teaches you to recognize it faster in the next, then what you're building isn't a portfolio or a holding company or a fund. It's a learning system whose unit of value isn't the buildings it owns but the relationship between them. The accumulated understanding of which loads are real and which ones we invented because we didn't know any better. But there's a wall the learning system hits, and I've watched otherwise very smart people pretend it doesn't exist. Someone still has to sit across from the board member who is furious about a landscaping bill and does not care, will never care, that an algorithm optimized the vendor selection. Someone has to hold the fiduciary duty, sign the document, absorb the particular species of anger that has nothing to do with the outcome and everything to do with not feeling heard by a person. The system can handle the problem. It cannot handle the person who has the problem. And so what persists, even as the parasitic load gets stripped from operation after operation, is a thin human layer of trust. Not because the system needs it but because the people inside the system need to believe someone with a pulse is accountable. Intelligence does the work. Humans provide the surface area for being sued. And underneath that surface the compounding continues, quiet, measurable, structural, in industry after industry priced for an era where the parasitic load was the business. The direction seems clear enough, more or less. But I keep thinking about the engineers who designed the original beams. They weren't wrong. They solved a real problem with real constraints and they were good at it. The problem just stopped being real. And their expertise, genuine and hard-won, is still sitting there. Load-bearing nothing.
