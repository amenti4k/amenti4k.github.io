I used to constantly fall prey to this — especially when working on projects in college — where talking to consumers in depth or deep rooted industry knowledge identifying a real gap was present. So I’d build products/tools that I thought were “cooool” and “useful”. 

Send it out after so many hours of iteration. Product is done. You’re on a high… the random people you sent it out to stop coming to the sites. There are no users and the website is a ghost town. 

It was a bloated MVP! 

So below are my lessons: 

- rephrase the word Minimum Viable Product with Minimum Viable “Thing”
    - what’s the thing that solves the solution - **value**
    - i believe the commoditization of engineering or product building has left the ability to build insanely “cool” looking tools, without the necessity of the product existing — thus “bloated mvp”
    - “is anyone getting anyyy value out of it? or do you have 0 users?”
- think of your #1 most compelling value prop story for your MVP
    - tell the story with as much **specific context** as possible
- generate specific value to 1–10 specific people you know, consistent with your specific value prop story earlier
    - the logo/ux can come in later
    - the aim of an mvp should be how can i get the first user and give them enough value to convince myself of the product i want to build

- coding the saying into an algorithm use a greedy search algorithm of giving value to someone. where maximum value can be generated is where entry should be done for even slight doubling down of features → further sales → a product → money etc…
- what’s the most manual way i can give value to a person, then when it’s actual value, i can scale it to a product
    - be a manual value consultant in your area — until you can’t scale it anymore because of need → then go on building the mvp

if all this is true, why are we then still building bloated mvps? 

- **Value Prop Blindness:** You don’t really understand what problem you’re solving, and you don’t realize how important it is to pass [this sanity check](https://medium.com/@lironshapira/how-to-sanity-check-your-startup-idea-dbb3ad4c9888) before building anything
- **Cargo Culting:** You want to build up your self-image as a “founder”, and you have a mental image of founders building products, so you set out to build a product
- **Social Permissivity:** The startup community hasn’t yet picked up on the idea that a Minimum Viable Product typically shouldn’t be an actual product, so you get to plow ahead in the wrong direction without feeling socially pressured by your startup-peers to course correct until it’s too late
- **Sense of Control:** Working on product design and engineering makes you feel (wrongly) like you know what you’re doing and you’re making tangible progress
- **Fun:** Product design is fun. Engineering is also fun.
