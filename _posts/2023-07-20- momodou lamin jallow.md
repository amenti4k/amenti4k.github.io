 **J Hus** 


Go listen to this guy. A true generational talent that's at his peak right now. 
I can't think of anyone that's at this potential level at the moment. 

I feel personally attached because of the following reasons: 

- There was a time where my most played genre was UK Hip Hop
- I'm Ethiopian and love the traditional African sounds/instruments
- I love it when words are emphasized and you can not only hear the words but feel them

But he's had a three album now; 

**1. Common Sense**
"Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum I came with bonsam" 


**2. Big Conspiracy**
"We run from 'rales with the mullianis
They can't see my face, I'm like a hijabi
I gotta stack bread 'cause I'm building my army
They know I'm so solid, they callin' me Harvey
I get all the 'usna and all of the narnis"



**3. Beautiful and Brutal Yard (BABY)**
"He weren't the same when I saw him again, he's a real shapeshifter
Used to pray facing qibla
I just chill in my sector, you know I'm Hannibal Lecter
Put that boy in his Pampers, us man, we're not rampers
Post outside, we're campers, come to your uni campus
Splash him, John the Baptist, I don't need no accomplice
Maybe only a driver, turn that man to a diver
That day, it was raining, put on the windscreen wiper" 



Also unrelated to Hus, but general music commentary -- it's truly magical how three biggest artists in the world can combine forces to make a song THAT boring. Hopefully Utopia isn't that bad.
