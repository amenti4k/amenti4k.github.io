**Below, I’ll explore the opportunity and indirect tax compliance market:**

Sales tax is very hard.

Sales tax is hard because the tax code is complex, unstandardized, and decentralized across 14,000+ jurisdictions in the US alone. Governments make businesses figure out how to comply with this complexity. Businesses are responsible for knowing where, when, and how much tax to collect; maintaining state registrations; and filing returns.

This is not just true in the US, it’s a global problem.

There are new startups focused on solving it for other geographies like Europe (i.e., [Taxdoo](https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/taxdoo-raises-64m-to-expand-from-tax-compliance-to-a-wider-set-of-financial-tools-for-e-commerce-companies/)) and Latam (i.e., [Brinta](https://www.brinta.com/)), while incumbents like Avalara are looking to expand their presence internationally.

### **Intro to Sales Tax.**

This morning, when you bought a coffee from your favorite local cafe, you probably paid 6-10% more than the sticker price because of this pervasive and ubiquitous thing called sales tax. Sales tax is embedded in virtually all commerce in every country, state, and municipality around the world. It’s a major source of revenue for state, local, and national governments.

The ancient Egyptians were the first civilization recorded to collect sales tax. Our modern sales tax system in the US traces its roots to the Great Depression when 25+ states established state-wide sales tax regimes to bolster revenue. Today, all but 5 states enforce sales tax. There is no escaping it if you consume or do business in our modern world. As Benjamin Franklin famously said:

*“in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes”.*

Why is Sales Tax so complex:

- Sales tax law is regulated by individual states, counties, and cities. There’s no universal standard. The tax law and rates in Ohio are different than in California.
- The US has ~14k different taxing jurisdictions. In 2022, there were 6k+ tax law changes made within those jurisdictions. The rules are complex and can vary dramatically depending on the industry, products sold, where and how they’re sold, etc.
- The tax code was written for a world in which commerce was primarily conducted in person. The internet changed all that. Today, every business is default national or global from day one. Businesses of all sizes deal with sales tax on a scale that was previously faced by only the largest Fortune 500 enterprises.
- Historically, internet companies only had to collect sales tax in states where they had a physical presence, also known as "[nexus](https://www.salestaxinstitute.com/sales_tax_faqs/what_is_nexus)” (retail stores, distribution centers, offices, etc.). Meaning most companies weren’t collecting sales tax in the majority of states where they sold products. A [2018 ruling called Wayfair vs South Dakota](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/21/17488472/south-dakota-wayfair-amazon-stock) changed everything, allowing states to enforce sales tax compliance on online purchases regardless of whether or not the company had a physical presence in the state. Today, 45 states and the District of Columbia enforce sales tax on internet companies.
- [Marketplace facilitator laws](https://www.milesconsultinggroup.com/blog/2020/03/24/what-you-need-to-know-about-marketplace-facilitator-legislation/) are another recent regulatory change. These laws force marketplaces like Amazon, Walmart, Etsy, etc. to collect and file sales tax on behalf of their merchants. States started passing these laws in 2019. Currently, 30+ states and counting have passed some form of marketplace facilitator law.
- The growth in remote work has also increased the burden of tax compliance because hiring a contractor or FTE in a new state triggers an immediate tax compliance obligation, even if the company has no sales in that state.
- Merchants don’t just sell physical products anymore. Now you can sell software, AI-generated art, e-books, data, subscription boxes, and whatever else entrepreneurs and creators make. Figuring out how your products are taxed is a challenge for modern companies that may not fit squarely into traditional boxes.

What customers expect

The last few years have seen tremendous innovation across B2B financial products. Today, you can set up payments ([Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/)); payroll ([Gusto](https://gusto.com/), [Rippling](https://www.rippling.com/), [Justworks](https://www.justworks.com/)); banking ([Mercury](https://mercury.com/)), corporate cards ([Ramp](https://ramp.com/), [Brex](https://www.brex.com/), [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/)); hire globally ([Deel](https://www.deel.com/), [Remote](https://remote.com/)), etc. — all in a matter of minutes. Hours at most. You don’t need to be an expert. You simply need to click and let modern software do its job.

Finance and accounting leaders have come to expect easy, intuitive, and elegant products, but that’s not what they get when shopping for a sales tax solution. The fact that getting sales tax compliant is still so difficult is what initially sparked most new tax startups’ curiosity.

Problems with existing software products

Today, you need to know a considerable amount about sales tax to successfully implement a sales tax product or pay someone who does. Avalara (the mid-market market leader) and [Vertex](https://www.vertexinc.com/) (the market leader in the Fortune 500) sell complex enterprise tools meant to be used by in-house tax teams and/or set up by Big 4 accounting firms. Implementation can take months, hundreds of hours of engineering/accounting resources, and cost tens of thousands of dollars.

These are the most common frustrations…

- Implementation is time-consumptive, painful, and expensive
- Pricing is cost-prohibitive for growing companies
- UI is confusing
- Not developer friendly
- The product tax codes don’t make sense for SaaS companies
- Mapping your products to the tax code is manual and confusing
- Customer support is terrible
- Missed or late tax filings
- Taxes being overpaid
- Inaccurate reporting data

### **Customer research**

Whatt I’ve seen from online reviews

*Avalara fucked up our setup, which caused us to not collect the right amount of sales tax. The difference came out of our pocket.*

CEO of an 8-figure ARR, Series A SaaS company

*The product works if you get it set up right, but it just sucks. Their pricing is outrageous. They charge you for API calls that expire. So even if you don’t use them all, you lose them going into the next billing period.*

CEO of a venture-backed alcohol marketplace

*It would have made our business unprofitable to comply with sales tax using Avalara so we decided to just risk getting audited until we have more revenue.*

CFO of a bootstrapped $7-figure digital products marketplace

*From start to finish, it took a bunch of time to implement Avalara. Probably 8 weeks… 3 engineers, me, and my accountant.*

CFO at a $9-figure+ e-commerce marketplace

*Because one of our products is taxed as Telecomm, we had to use two different APIs because the Telecomm product is different than the AvaTax product. Which made our engineers lives miserable for a couple months. We’ve actually still not finished getting it setup.*

Controller at a ~$40M ARR, Series B SaaS company.

*I never know what I’m supposed to do with the information that Avalara gives me on a given state. Sales tax is risk management, and unless I pay them or an accounting firm 10k, I’m left shooting in the dark.*

CFO of a 7-figure ARR venture-backed SaaS Company

*We ended up with $1M in liabilities plus penalites from different states because we started growing too fast. Our controller didn’t know what to do. So we tried to go to Avalara to get it fixed, but they ghosted us on our first meeting then tried to charge us $3k for something called a nexus study before they could give us a quote….*

Founder of an 8-figure e-commerce holding company

*Stripe Tax was too expensive and incomprehensive. Avalara was also very expensive, but at a certain business scale they’re the only credible option…. We probably spent about 30-40 engineering hours on the Avalara implementation in total. Not including my time or my CFOs.*

CEO of an 8-figure ARR Series A SaaS company

*Our accounting firm told us to use Avalara…. They ended up registering us in too many states and then didn’t do the registrations right in some states. So I had to go figure out how to manually log-in to each state’s website and figure out what was going wrong…. Can’t believe I spend $50k a year on this.*

CEO of an e-commerce marketplace

*Implementation was a bitch. The docs were inaccurate. We had to get on multiple calls with their support engineers just to figure out what was going on…. The total setup ended up taking like 6 months.*

Engineering Manager at $80M+ Series D SaaS Company

*I’d rip out Avalara tomorrow if a better product came long*

CTO of a $100M+ e-commerce brand

*Avalara overpaid one state by $100k for one of my clients. We couldn’t even get ahold of their customer service to fix it.*

### **Market**

This industry is the classic story of a dominant legacy incumbent starting to show important weaknesses that newer competitors are looking to exploit. Mainly, it is a red ocean market opportunity, with a go-to-market strategy that heavily relies on flawless execution.

The distinction, though, as early-stage investors, is that there are many startup competitors as well that have entered the market in the last 12 to 24 months.

What the market looks like today

Incumbents:

- [Avalara](https://softwarestackinvesting.com/a-first-look-at-the-compliance-cloud/): Comprehensive tax compliance solution with (almost) global coverage. Known for its strong branding but has faced customer frustrations. They were bought out by Vista for $8.4B in October, 2022.
- [Vertex](https://www.vertexinc.com/) & [Sovos](https://sovos.com/): Enterprise-grade solutions with deep tax expertise. Sovos is more prominent in Europe. Vertex is a publicly traded company with a $3.5B market cap, and Sovos had been bought by Vista and more recently owned by HgCapital.
- [TaxJar](https://www.taxjar.com/): User-friendly, e-commerce focused. Struggled with the SaaS market due to limited partnerships with billing platforms.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/tax): Attempted to dominate billing, payments and tax, but faced challenges in execution and integration post TaxJar acquisition.
- [Thomson Reuters](https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/en/onesource/tax-provision): a ~$60B public company that also has a suite of legacy enterprise tax products.

Startups:

- [Anrok](https://www.anrok.com/) (most similar to Taxwire): Focused on post PMF SaaS companies. They have the most developed product and business for SaaS sales tax of any startup to date. They raised a $20M Series A in 2022 at a $100M valuation, led by Index Ventures and Sequoia Capital, and are rumored to have around $5M in revenue.
- [Zamp](https://zamp.com/): Primarily focused on e-commerce brands. They’ve chosen to take a very services-heavy approach to what they’re building.
- [Numeral](https://www.google.com/search?q=numeral+e-commerce&oq=numeral+e-commerce&aqs=chrome..69i57.3016j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8): A startup from the most recent Y Combinator batch. They’re focused on handling filing & remittance for e-commerce companies. Biggest strength is that the founders have e-commerce backgrounds.

First, enterprise-graded companies are unlikely to switch providers. Most of the very large companies already have a solution (and those that don’t may choose not because they do highly concentrated sales). The long term opportunity of targeting the younger SaaS market is to grow as many of these startups scale, but there’s no immediate opportunity today to win big accounts.

Second, Avalara absolutely dominates the mid-market. Here, it is Avalara versus everyone else. Their core product was designed in the 2000s. The rest of it has been stitched together with the 18+ acquisitions they’ve made since. Internally, their tax filings are entirely manual. The product experience is clunky and overwhelming for non-experts. Their tax codes aren’t configured for tech companies. Their international product is weak. For example, large enterprises like [Mindbody](https://www.mindbodyonline.com/) (Avalara customer) are expanding internationally and choosing to go with alternative products for international tax compliance.

If you talk to Avalara’s customers and partners, you’ll discover that they’ve created a lot of frustration and animosity in the market. Since being acquired by Vista, customer service has declined, compliance mistakes increased, and pricing has gone up. Avalara’s NPS is 13.

TaxJar (founded in 2013) was the closest thing to a real Avalara alternative, but Stripe has de-prioritized it since acquiring the company in 2021 (rumored at ~$400M), [laying off](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/19/stripe-layoffs-taxjar-tech/) most of its team and halting GTM. Remaining efforts by Stripe in this space are focused on Stripe Tax.

[Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax) is not a true enterprise product. It can be good enough for small companies, but the fees, tax engine breadth, and lack of compliance features (filing, monitoring, registrations, etc.) prevent it from being a real solution for growing companies. Stripe Tax has access to Stripe data, and falls short in analyzing a company’s broader context. 

Global sales tax compliance is a growing market. States and countries aren’t going to stop collecting taxes. Recent regulatory changes like Wayfair have increased compliance burdens. There are still many non-compliant companies that will need to get compliant. [States are cracking down](https://www.pyapc.com/insights/sales-tax-on-digital-services-the-multistate-challenge-to-comply/) and the [number of audits seem to be rising](https://www.taxnotes.com/tax-notes-state/audits/sales-tax-audits-are-rise-are-you-ready/2023/07/03/7gxcw).

### **Concluding remarks**

There are two main reasons why now may be good timing for a new player to enter the space: (1) market changes, and (2) increased regulations:

- Avalara has been [acquired](https://www.avalara.com/us/en/about/press/category/2022/08/avalara-acquisition.html) by PE, and their product isn’t built for what many customers need today. They’re also more focused on moving up-market (competing with Vertex for Fortune 500 clients), cutting costs, and raising prices. They’ve created a lot of frustration among their customers and partners, and TaxJar is no longer a major player, so there’s no clear challenger to Avalara.
- Regulatory changes like Wayfair vs South Dakota and marketplace facilitator laws coupled with increasing scrutiny from the states have made sales tax compliance a larger priority than ever.

However, there is no clear opportunity to leverage newer technologies (i.e., LLMs) to disrupt the industry. A few examples of suggested uses of LLMs:

- Ffacilitate a much faster onboarding process by understanding the business situation of customers using LLMs. During onboarding, users can explain their business in natural language, give a link they can scrape, so they can better automate the understanding and explaining of a company’s taxability.
- Building a tax engine from scratch involves aggregating and interpreting large amounts of text and converting that into math. LLMs have already proven powerful for us in moving faster on understanding and interpreting the tax code.

The opportunity, as I see it, is to build best-in-class modern software with a great user experience that every company loves using. I’ve struggled to find a product approach that would afford a startup an unfair/intrinsic advantage in its go-to market, which is what we’re looking for in software opportunities we back. Tax compliance is a low-margin-for-error problem space, offering no room for true innovation. At the end of the day, most startups can't control the regulations and how each State treats taxes, and companies are forced to play by their rules.

A big challenge is that the pull for tax compliance arises at specific growth milestones, so it is not a problem for most younger companies until it is.
