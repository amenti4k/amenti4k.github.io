**The Three Components of the Unstructured Data Stack**  
*Unstructured data has become the frontier of data innovation, unlocking unprecedented opportunities for organizations to gain strategic insights and drive growth.*

---

### **What is Unstructured Data?**  
- Information that does not conform to a predefined data model or schema.  
- Comprises **80-90% of all new data generated**, offering immense value if harnessed effectively.  
- Its complexity and lack of structure, however, challenge traditional data infrastructure stacks.  

As organizations increasingly recognize its potential, a new unstructured data stack has emerged, consisting of three core components: **data extraction and ingestion**, **data processing**, and **data management**.

### **1. Data Extraction and Ingestion**  
This step captures, extracts, transforms, and optimizes unstructured data for storage and further use.

- **Capture and Extract**:  
  - Sources include social media, customer feedback, emails, and beyond.  
  - Techniques: web scraping, API integrations, file parsing.  
  - Teams may create custom extractors or rely on pre-built solutions to achieve high extraction accuracy.  

- **Emerging Technologies**:  
  - Tools like Reducto, Tensorlake, Unstructured.io, LlamaParse, and Vectorize are revolutionizing document parsing.  
  - Unlike older Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) services using OCR, these modern tools leverage vision models to improve parsing accuracy, particularly for text-dominant modalities used by large language models (LLMs).  

- **Partition and Optimize**:  
  - Data is semantically partitioned into smaller, logical units for contextual relevance.  
  - Results are formatted in machine-readable structures (e.g., JSON), enabling preprocessing tasks like cleaning and embedding generation.  

- **Storage Destination**:  
  - Extracted data is stored in scalable systems like object storage data lakes or databases, ready for use in applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  

**Key Considerations**:  
  - Accuracy and speed of extraction for high data volumes.  
  - Support for multimodal data transformation.

### **2. Data Processing**  
Unstructured data undergoes further transformation and analysis to unlock its full utility.

- **Transformation and Cleansing**:  
  - Cleansing ensures data consistency, while normalization prepares it for downstream applications.  

- **Processing Engines**:  
  - Categorized by their focus (structured vs. unstructured data), scalability (single-node vs. distributed), and languages (SQL vs. Python).  
  - Popular engines like Spark, Dask, and Modin cater primarily to structured data, but emerging tools like **Daft** are gaining attention for their ability to handle multimodal data efficiently in distributed environments.  

- **Scalability Challenges**:  
  - Processing engines often face performance and memory constraints when scaling to medium and large datasets.  
  - Solutions enabling seamless scalability from single-node to distributed architectures—without rewriting code or preemptive cluster setup—are becoming essential.

### **3. Data Management**  
The backbone of the unstructured data stack, data management encompasses the organization, storage, and governance of unstructured data.  

- **Key Functions**:  
  - Organizing and storing data to ensure easy retrieval and analysis.  
  - Implementing data governance policies for compliance, security, and privacy.  

- **Regulatory and Privacy Safeguards**:  
  - Policies control data access and usage, safeguarding sensitive information while empowering data-driven decision-making.  

- **File Formats and Challenges**:  
  - **Apache Parquet**, a widely adopted column-oriented format, is prevalent in object storage systems but has limitations:  
    - Full-page loading for single-row lookups is inefficient.  
    - Handling wide columns typical of unstructured data is resource-intensive.  
    - Limited encoding options and metadata constraints at the page level hinder performance.

**Conclusion**  
The unstructured data stack is still in its infancy. It needs to work and will eventually work as companies can transform this untapped resource into a competitive advantage. The stack’s evolution will undoubtedly shape the future of data infrastructure.
