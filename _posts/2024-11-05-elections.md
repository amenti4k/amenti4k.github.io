I'm just using [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11245/2024-us-presidential-election-winner/)

I'm not sure how accurate it is, but it's fun to watch.

Unlike the other prediction markets -- polymarket, kalshi, etc -- this one seems more grounded is easy to use and has a simple interface.

Others remind me of betting on sports or gamified gambling on politics without substance.
