I like seeing probability weights on different outcomes on [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com) and recently been following the [2024 US Presidential Election Winner](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11245/2024-us-presidential-election-winner/) question.

I'm not sure how accurate it is, but it's fun to watch.

Unlike the other prediction markets -- polymarket, kalshi, etc -- this one seems more grounded and the comment section feels like a bunch of datasceinstists debating about how each incident affects the market without the chaos from either party -- at least relatively. 

Others remind me of betting on sports or gamified gambling on politics without substance. 

Try it out and read the comments!
