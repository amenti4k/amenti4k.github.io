- **Startups, Open Water Swimming, and Ventures**

    - It's interesting how a lack of resources can reveal who truly has what it takes.
        - When capital is plentiful, it's easy to mistake luck for skill, or to think a solid business model is the reason behind success when it's just favorable conditions.
        - The startups that endure are led by founders who not only survive but thrive amid adversity.
            - Providing too much early funding is like handing out boats—it speeds up the journey but hides who's actually steering.
                - They might reach the next milestone faster, but we lose sight of who's navigating. Is it a resourceful leader making wise decisions, or someone who would struggle the moment they have to swim on their own?
                - The path for startups, especially those seeking significant venture returns, demands more than a quick ride over calm waters.
                    - Boats are helpful for short distances; most of the journey requires genuine swimming.

- **Becoming a Better Swimmer (Founder)**

    - This involves:
        - **Training:** Mastering the techniques, understanding the currents.
        - **Mentality:** Having the courage to dive in, even when the waters are rough.
        - **Experience:** Building resilience from overcoming previous challenges.
        - **Gear:** While sometimes necessary, often it's the mindset and endurance that matter most.

- **Evaluating Founders and Investments**

    - Founders need to ask themselves honestly: *Am I ready for this?* Who will support me when the seas get rough? A VC like Benchmark isn't just providing capital; they're willing to swim alongside you if needed.
    - For investors, the challenge is to discern whether this person can "swim" through their specific market, considering the competition and potential hazards.
        - It takes deep knowledge of the "waters" to make the right judgment.

- **Testing in Calm Waters Before Facing the Open Sea**

    - We look for founders who have proven they can swim in smaller, controlled environments—a local lake—before venturing into the vast ocean with them.
    - Programs like YC act as training grounds, transitioning founders from the safety of a pool to the unpredictability of open waters, but the real sea is a different realm entirely.
        - Some adapt seamlessly to the larger challenges, while others find themselves unprepared.

- **Cofounders: The Essential Crew**

    - A cofounder with technical expertise is like having a seasoned swimmer who knows when to adjust their stroke and how to navigate changing tides.
    - While it's possible to go it alone, a cofounder who understands your strengths and weaknesses from the start is invaluable.
        - They know when to shed unnecessary weight, hold onto what's essential, and keep you afloat when the waves become overwhelming.
            - In the end, survival hinges on wisdom, skill, and time—lessons that only experience can teach.
