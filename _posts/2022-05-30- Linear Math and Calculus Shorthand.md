==========================================

I keep on forgetting basic maths. Especially rule based ones. So, just to make sure I don't keep forgetting basic linear maths and calculus, I made a shortnote document that just summarizes all the basic concepts in a reminder instead of an indepth exploration. I basically just made a summary note out of intro CS math classes that I took at college to make a refresher...Refer whenever forgetting creeps in...
