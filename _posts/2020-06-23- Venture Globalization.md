ðŸ’¡ I used DHL's Global Connectedness Index about globalization to extrapolate to the Venture Capital industry in the global market.

The venture-capital industry â€“ originating in the US â€“ is envied mainly throughout the world as a rear engine of innovation and economic growth. However, people with a distorted sense of globalization tend to underestimate the need for adapting to different markets while operating VC funds. On one side, popular media portrays the resurgence of protectionism and nationalism through an emphasis on deteriorating trade agreements, the US-China trade war, placement and removal of tariffs, and political backlash in countries with austerity programs. Meanwhile, the rapid rise of online connectivity â€“ especially social media, has overshadowed reality to give an inflated view of a flattened world. The combination of both phenomena, thus, gives rise to a skewed understanding â€“ "the world is very connected but decelerating due to socioeconomic and political tensions." 

The authors of the global connectedness index aim at correcting the distorted view by proving that globalization isn't a one-time phenomenon but a process of change through time. They reframe globalization as a process using four metrics â€“ trade, capital, information, and people â€“ at different levels of analysis. The intensity of the relationships and variety of those relationships among countries.

Depth of the metrics in how much the country engages in each activity shows the intensity in international business compared to localized movements. Although, as VC money circulates through international boundaries, it's affected by cyclical and structural economic determinants. Visible economic growth could be attributed to the structural factors â€“ indicating increasing connectedness. However, volatility in cyclical economic factors and macroeconomic situations could cloud results from being completely attributed to globalization.

While the breadth of the metrics implies the range of regional relationships by the VC, breadth is profoundly affected by "The Law of Distance", indicating interactions are dampened by distance along the sociocultural and geographic reach. In addition to "cultural affinities, political agreements, and infrastructure links," as the startup ecosystem of a country develops along with viable market size, the prospect for investment increases. However, due to (1) the considerable investment risk that goes along with VC funding, and (2) slow growth curve for new investment hubs to develop; the breadth is limited as VCs become risk-averse towards new regions. Breadth remains relatively stable with slow growth.

Thus, the author's usage of a cumulation between depth and breadth to indicate globalization indexes apply to VCs. The weight of the average might weigh more towards depth, as breadth might be significantly harder for VCs to penetrate. Even in an ideally connected world, in-depth insider knowledge of the economy and sectors within a country is needed to enable investing and expanding to newer hubs.

The four metrics are used to functionalize globalization by embodying critical indicators of a truly global market. The metrics provide cohesive rhetoric in defining globalization. Although each of the pillars affects and is affected by global expansion, some are more relevant depending on the industry. For venture capital and private equity firms, the movement of people, though significant, is of least relevance. Trade and information flow accompany VCs in the process of globalization. Unsurprisingly, the capital pillar has more sway in functionalizing VC globalization.

As markets become attractive, there are multiple ways to infuse money to high-growth, high-yield startups, and companies alike. Money gets injected through trade deals like bilateral treaties that favor taxation avoidance, where shares are exempted from taxation. Secondly, through FDI, given that legislative barriers permit such activity for VC and PE funds through a structure usually known as a Financial Foreign Direct Investment(FFDI). Third, through joint ventures in regions with lesser expertise and more legal hurdles.

The circulation of more capital reduces the tangible and intangible trade costs, creating trust, and thus generating a competitive advantage for local, innovative companies to flourish. This economic development must be distributed in emerging countries as well to boost globalization. Foreign funds face hurdles when investing in emerging markets. One hindrance is the lack of appropriate exit strategies that give sizable returns to angel and seed-stage investors. IPO stock markets or acquisition strategies are underdeveloped or non-existent. Even with the growth and expansion of local firms, a phenomenon of "semi-globalization" remains in developed countries.

Per the argument above, I used the cumulative Global Connectedness Score to analyze countries on the steepest growth and decile. Using the SLOPE function to indicate the steepness of points, Mozambique and Iran showed extreme values of the rise and drop respectively

Iran, a country with the 4th biggest oil reserve, occupies a critical geographical area in the middle east. The reform process that started in 2005 radicalized the Shia Muslim country to adopt a strict Sharia Law. Funding Hezbollah - a terrorist group against Israel and enrichment of Uranium caused regional tensions to rise and culminate in UN sanctions imposed in 2006 that resulted in economic blockade from the rest of the world. After sanctions, prices of goods dramatically rose and the startup scene got affected.

As the UN put sanctions on the country, outside investment and trade that was incoming shut off. Due to the rising living conditions within the state, startups, and independent businesses - that are premier targets for VCs - weaned off and growth declined. Second, the venture capitals that were highly concentrated around western powers, and China feared the political instability.

Classifying for general failures of venture capital investment in Iran, it could be due to formal and informal barriers. Significant formal deficiencies are similar to emerging markets. They include a lack of financial regulations, inefficacy in tax, labor, financial disclosure, investment protection laws, and capital market underdevelopment. Iran's informal barriers widened the formal institutional voids. Strains include a culture that heavily disapproves of capitalism and an infiltrated culture of secrecy.

Although local firms operationalize and are making moves, they are usually government sponsored. This hamper and disturbs private VC funds into making biased and manipulated investment decisions. The displacement of funds from private investors leads to a lack of mature VCs that create a self-sustained venture capital market, that can't even develop in Iran â€“ let alone expand internationally.

Mozambique's story is of rising from demise with the right reforms.6 The country had been underdeveloped due to the two-decade-long civil war. However, after 1994, the economy had been in recovery mode and reviving. Coincidentally, the natural resources of the country shot it into the global playing field as aluminum exports proliferated, followed by the discovery of vast reserves of natural gas and coal in the early 2000s. 

International economic support with newly discovered resources diversified the country's economy supporting old industries of agriculture and tourism. Throughout these years, the government of Mozambique set attractive legislative and policy practices that made the right balance of national development and attraction of foreign investment for building a long-term, inclusive, and sustainable ecosystem.7 Plus, the government introduced privatization of formerly state-owned entities, especially in agriculture and natural resource exploitation.

FDI, in the form of venture capital and private equity in Mozambique, is incentivized by the integration of the country to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) that opens access to member countries.  Even with substantial constraints of administrative, infrastructural, and bureaucratic difficulties seen in Iran,
the government's reforms have significantly moved the country in the right direction. Given the reform-minded government, the attractiveness of the market remains with significant rewards that keep pushing Mozambique as a good investment location in Africa.
