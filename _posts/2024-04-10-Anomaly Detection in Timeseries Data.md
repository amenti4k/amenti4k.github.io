# Anomaly Detection in Timeseries Data

### Description

For general use of for internal needs for a prospecting tool monitoring time-series trends, identifying inflections/anomalies, and present filters. I imagine it’s a tool that let’s you put in a metric or query and it generates a basic time-series prediction and then can notify you if its out of bounds given input bounds and alert thresholds. I was playing around with the idea last night (attached) and hosting it on streamlit for easy interactions.

PS: (1) used data like DAU, Funding Rounds, Acquisition Amounts, NYC taxi riders etc as I thought they're similar/relevant to the type of data most of the readers here ingest…
