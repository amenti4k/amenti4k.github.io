*The theory goes: limited (curation mattered but it was solo dumping, not essential )→ universal consensus voting (multiple options and choose based on actual democracy) → age of too many good options (tell me what I like)*


I BUILT AN ONLINE RADIO THAT I UPDATE EVERY 2 DAYS. I love sharing music w friends and wanted a corner on the internet to do that.

**Thesis:** there is something to be said about curation in the day we live in. We grew up on it. Music discovery was MTV and the billboard top 100. I was plugged into the radio growing up to just know what was considered “good”/”cool”.

Now it’s more general public consensus. TikTok allows for true virality of a snippet of a song. Twitter/Instagram/YouTube allow for open conversations on what’s good/not. What’s hot and what’s not.

Current state of streaming and radio: Streaming revolutionised music listening by giving users on-demand access to everything — the opposite of radio. But, over time, streaming has started to look a lot like its predecessor. Streaming services now push algorithmically-generated playlists and ready-made mixes to soundtrack activities, like working out and cooking. Spotify’s AI-powered voice DJ is a lot like listening to a radio DJ provide context on their curated mix of songs. We even have streaming stations”! Where is all this heading?

Given the noise, the true winners can be picked. They’re generally agreed on. It became democratic.

But it isn’t inherently democratic. Sometimes we need the “real ones” or the “cultural curators” to tell us what’s good and what isn’t.

NOTICE: GenZ didn’t know MTV or Radio. What good was decided with consensus instead of up down.

The recent incredible growth of “Youtube Reaction Channels” is an indication of that. Which leads me to…

**We need new methods of content recommendation/curation that’s based on the curator’s taste.** 

Derrick Gee: he’s a TikTok previous radio show host that has very respectable and professions (but still loving) insight on music. People started flooding into hearing what he proposed. He sort of started becoming a tastemaker for people that wanted to escape the current musical bubble.

He started playlists (including other Spoitify playlist makers that became professional discovery helpers).

This was the initial trigger for an inspiration that I’me believed for a while. it’s not anything that’s new.

One thing that I know I’m good at is galvanizing a direction so that people but shit that’s cool.

- Taste + Momentum + Leading

Personally, it feels very rewarding as it feels like the intersection of all the things that I like: Imagine being Marty – the founder of poolsuite – and saying this. This is exactly all of my worlds colliding.

I think there is something to be said about the original style (retro desktop) vibe that poolsuite.fm had created.

It could be vinyl, cassette, or CD players. Or it can randomly simulate other stuff. I think it’s incredible.

One thing about this musical experience is **I want it to be as fun as humanly possible and interpreted on a computer as it can possibly become. FUN AND CULTURED.**
