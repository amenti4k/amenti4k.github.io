[Beware of the Casual Polymath](https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/28/polymath/)

I find myself being curious about a broad range of topics. And I’m not along in this. Most of us get caught up in interesting rabbit-holes which we explore in depth. In doing so, the label “polymath” starts floating around; either through self-labeling for just an explanatory adjective and sometimes for prestige, or others calling us polymaths due to the seemingly vast variety of topics we have *expertise* on. 

>My point is that we should not trust or glorify people on the basis of their apparent “Universal Genius”. Having a variety of interests is no more a sign of generalized intelligence than being able to walk and chew gum. And if someone does appear to have accomplishments in a variety of domains with fungible currency, their total status should not be a sum or multiple, but merely the status of their single most impressive feat.

The blog argues against the presence of the casual polymath and how the generalization to multiple disciples is faulty. An expert in one domain can master an unrelated skill, and be perceived as having general intelligence that can be extrapolated to another subject matter. If I’m good at data science, finance, and epidemiology, should you trust my opinions on politics as well? 

> So go read your SaaS/Meta-Science/Aerospace blog and revel in the genuine joy of intellectual curiosity. As Tyler Cowen would say, I’m just here to lower the status of polymaths.
