- **Startups <> Open Water Swimming <> Ventures**
    - It's wild, but sometimes you *need* a lack of resources to really see who’s got what it takes.
        - When capital is abundant, it’s easy to mistake a solid founder or business model for just a fortunate alignment of external factors.
        - Ultimately, the startups that make it are led by founders who can survive—and even thrive—through intense waves. Giving too much early funding is like handing out boats; it speeds things up but obscures who’s truly navigating.
            - Sure, they’ll reach the next checkpoint faster, but you lose sight of who’s driving. Are they a resilient fighter using resources wisely, or someone who would flounder the second they need to swim without support?
            - The journey for startups, especially venture-backed ones that need significant returns, demands more than a quick ride across smooth water.
                - Boats work only for short distances; most of the journey requires genuine swimming.
                
    - **Becoming a Better Swimmer (Founder)**
        - Requires:
            - **Training:** Knowing the strokes, understanding the landscape.
            - **Mentality:** The resilience to dive in, even when it’s rough.
            - **Experience:** The grit earned from prior challenges.
            - **Gear:** Sometimes essential, but often, it’s mindset and endurance that matter more.

    - **Evaluating Founders and Investments**
        - Founders must be brutally honest with themselves: *Can I handle this?* Who will support me in rough waters? Think of a VC like Benchmark—they’re not just giving you a boat but willing to swim alongside if needed.
        - For investors, the rigor lies in discerning if this person has the ability to “swim” through their particular market, considering who else is competing and the terrain’s hazards.
            - It takes knowing the “water” deeply to judge correctly.

    - **Testing in Calm Waters Before Open Seas**
        - You want to see founders who can swim competently in smaller, controlled environments—a local lake, if you will—before you venture into the vast ocean with them.
        - YC is a bit like a training ground; it preps founders in a controlled pool-to-lake transition, but even then, the real open water is a different game.
            - Some graduates adapt brilliantly to the larger ocean, but many simply aren’t equipped.
            
    - **Cofounders: Essential Crew Members**
        - The right cofounder, especially one with technical strengths, is like having someone who understands different swimming techniques and when to use an oxygen tank.
        - Going it alone is possible, but a cofounder who knows your strengths and weaknesses from the start is invaluable.
            - They’ll know when to shed extra weight, hold onto essentials, and keep you afloat during massive waves.
                - Ultimately, experience teaches what’s worth holding onto—because in the end, survival demands wisdom, skill, and time.
