##### An Innovation Cascade....

The Cutting-Edge Innovation Layer has historically been represented by expensive, institutional-level technology:<span class="marginnote">The cost curve here is steeper than it looks. ENIAC's <span class="inline-code">$7M (1945)</span> bought roughly 5,000 additions per second — today a $0.10 microcontroller outperforms it by orders of magnitude.</span>
* 1940s: ENIAC at $7M ($100M+ adjusted)
* 1960s: IBM Mainframes at millions per unit
* 1970s: Early minicomputers at hundreds of thousands

Today this layer is represented by closed-source cloud AI (OpenAI, Anthropic) and is characterized by:
* Highest performance capabilities
* Highest operational costs
* <span class="highlight-text">Limited accessibility</span>
* First-mover advantage in new capabilities

The Commercial Adaptation Layer has historical parallels in:<span class="marginnote">The historical analogy partially breaks down here. Unlike minicomputers and enterprise software, open-source AI models like <span class="inline-code">Llama</span> and <span class="inline-code">Mistral</span> close the performance gap with proprietary leaders far faster than any prior generation of technology.</span>
* 1980s: Business-grade minicomputers
* 1990s: Enterprise software solutions
* 2000s: Early cloud services

Today this layer is represented by open-source cloud AI (Llama, Mistral) and is characterized by:
* Slightly behind cutting edge
* More economical pricing
* Broader accessibility
* Proven technological approaches

The Mass Adoption Layer has historical examples including:
* 1990s: Personal computers
* 2000s: Open source software
* 2010s: Mobile computing

Today this layer is represented by local inference and is characterized by:<span class="marginnote">Local inference today means running quantized models — <span class="inline-code">GGUF</span>, <span class="inline-code">GPTQ</span>, or <span class="inline-code">AWQ</span> formats — on consumer GPUs or even CPUs. The tradeoff is precision for accessibility, but for most practical tasks the loss is negligible.</span>
* Mature technology
* Minimal operational costs
* Universal accessibility
* Maximum deployment flexibility

<span class="highlight-text">A key historical pattern shows that technology inevitably flows from expensive/exclusive to affordable/accessible:</span>
* Mainframes → Personal computers
* Private networks → Internet
* Premium software → Open source

Performance gaps between layers decrease over time:<span class="marginnote">This convergence is accelerating. In prior computing eras, it took roughly a decade for mass-market hardware to match institutional performance. In AI, open-source models now trail frontier models by months, not years.</span>
* Example: <span class="highlight-text">Modern $300 smartphone exceeds 1990s supercomputer</span>
* Example: Free Linux matches/exceeds commercial Unix

In the end state:<span class="marginnote">The wildcard is whether regulatory capture or hardware bottlenecks (e.g., TSMC concentration, GPU supply chains) could slow or distort this pattern in AI specifically — something previous technology waves did not face at this scale.</span>
* <span class="highlight-text">Mass adoption layer typically ends up with the majority of capabilities</span>
* <span class="highlight-text">Democratization of technology leads to greatest total impact</span>
* Innovation cycle continues with new cutting-edge developments
