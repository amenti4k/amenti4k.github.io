Let me rewrite this from our technical and historical perspective, focusing on how innovation cycles have played out across time:

• Cutting-Edge Innovation Layer
    - Historically represented by expensive, institutional-level technology
        * 1940s: ENIAC at $7M ($100M+ adjusted)
        * 1960s: IBM Mainframes at millions per unit
        * 1970s: Early minicomputers at hundreds of thousands
    - Today represented by closed-source cloud AI (OpenAI, Anthropic)
    - Characterized by:
        * Highest performance capabilities
        * Highest operational costs
        * Limited accessibility
        * First-mover advantage in new capabilities

• Commercial Adaptation Layer
    - Historical parallels:
        * 1980s: Business-grade minicomputers
        * 1990s: Enterprise software solutions
        * 2000s: Early cloud services
    - Today represented by open-source cloud AI (Llama, Mistral)
    - Characterized by:
        * Slightly behind cutting edge
        * More economical pricing
        * Broader accessibility
        * Proven technological approaches

• Mass Adoption Layer
    - Historical examples:
        * 1990s: Personal computers
        * 2000s: Open source software
        * 2010s: Mobile computing
    - Today represented by local inference
    - Characterized by:
        * Mature technology
        * Minimal operational costs
        * Universal accessibility
        * Maximum deployment flexibility

• Key Historical Pattern
    - Technology inevitably flows from expensive/exclusive to affordable/accessible
        * Mainframes → Personal computers
        * Private networks → Internet
        * Premium software → Open source
    - Performance gaps between layers decrease over time
        * Example: Modern $300 smartphone exceeds 1990s supercomputer
        * Example: Free Linux matches/exceeds commercial Unix
    
• End State
    - Mass adoption layer typically ends up with the majority of capabilities
    - Democratization of technology leads to greatest total impact
    - Innovation cycle continues with new cutting-edge developments

This pattern has repeated consistently throughout technological history, suggesting the same will likely occur with AI deployment models.
