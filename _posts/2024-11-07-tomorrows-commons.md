##### An Innovation Cascade....

The Cutting-Edge Innovation Layer has historically been represented by expensive, institutional-level technology:
* 1940s: ENIAC at $7M ($100M+ adjusted)
* 1960s: IBM Mainframes at millions per unit
* 1970s: Early minicomputers at hundreds of thousands

Today this layer is represented by closed-source cloud AI (OpenAI, Anthropic) and is characterized by:
* Highest performance capabilities
* Highest operational costs
* Limited accessibility
* First-mover advantage in new capabilities

The Commercial Adaptation Layer has historical parallels in:
* 1980s: Business-grade minicomputers
* 1990s: Enterprise software solutions
* 2000s: Early cloud services

Today this layer is represented by open-source cloud AI (Llama, Mistral) and is characterized by:
* Slightly behind cutting edge
* More economical pricing
* Broader accessibility
* Proven technological approaches

The Mass Adoption Layer has historical examples including:
* 1990s: Personal computers
* 2000s: Open source software
* 2010s: Mobile computing

Today this layer is represented by local inference and is characterized by:
* Mature technology
* Minimal operational costs
* Universal accessibility
* Maximum deployment flexibility

A key historical pattern shows that technology inevitably flows from expensive/exclusive to affordable/accessible:
* Mainframes → Personal computers
* Private networks → Internet
* Premium software → Open source

Performance gaps between layers decrease over time:
* Example: Modern $300 smartphone exceeds 1990s supercomputer
* Example: Free Linux matches/exceeds commercial Unix
    
In the end state:
* Mass adoption layer typically ends up with the majority of capabilities
* Democratization of technology leads to greatest total impact
* Innovation cycle continues with new cutting-edge developments
