>
> It must be noted the adoption of these tokens also depends on early
> adopters that believe in the utility of having an algorithmic ideal
> money. However, believing alone doesn\'t guarantee people onboarding
> onto the system. So when building these tokens, it's essential to

>
> Ponzinomics is the alchemy of the process of combining a set of assets

> interests that are well aligned to keep a peg. The ponzinomics can be
> thought of getting enough "trampoline effect" for the algorithmic
> stablecoin to reach mass adoption. This is usually done for token
> holders by providing arbitrage opportunities with monetary rewards to
> those that actively participate in the game theory by making choices
> that - according to the subjective algorithmic method used - stabilize
> the peg.
>
> Although ponzi-nomics and arbitrage opportunities are common in most
> cryptocurrency protocols, they are especially difficult at the initial
> stages of non-collateralized algorithmic stablecoins because of the
> inherent reflexivity of stablecoins. The issue is summarized with the
> "Paradox of Stability". Algo-stablecoins work in a way where expanding
> the supply reduces the price, and contracting the supply increases the
> price. In practice, however, supply changes usually amplify the
> directional momentum -- especially in multi-token models that have
> stable-coins and governing tokens.
>
> In order to achieve price stability, an algorithmic stablecoin must
> expand to a market cap large enough that buy and sell orders do not
> cause price fluctuations. However, the only way for a purely
> algorithmic stablecoin to grow to a large enough network size is
> through speculation and reflexivity, and the problem with
> highly-reflexive growth is that it is unsustainable, and contraction
> is often equally reflexive. Hence the paradox: the larger the network
> value of the stablecoin, the more resilient it will be to large price
> shocks. Yet only highly-reflexive algorithmic stablecoins---those that

>
> Let me explain with a simple example:
>
> Say I have 100 AMPL tokens worth \$1 each, enough to buy a \$100

>
> \## The Seigniorage Shares Approach: Basis Protocol
>
> While Ampleforth tried to solve stability through universal rebasing,
> Basis took a different approach based on Robert Sams\' seigniorage
> shares theory. Instead of adjusting everyone\'s wallets, they created
> a three-token system:
>
> 1\. Basis Coins - The stablecoin meant to stay at \$1\
> 2. Basis Bonds - Issued when price falls below \$1, redeemable for new
> coins when price recovers\
> 3. Basis Shares - Receive newly minted coins when price is above \$1
> (after bonds are paid)
>
> The mechanism works like this:\
> - Price below \$1? Contract supply by selling bonds at a discount\
> - Price above \$1? Expand supply by minting new coins to pay
> bondholders first, then shareholders\
> - Bonds expire after 5 years if not redeemed

The game theory here is more sophisticated than Ampleforth\'s. Let\'s
break down the incentives:

> During price drops (\<\$1):\
> - The protocol offers discounted bonds to reduce coin supply\
> - Traders are incentivized to buy bonds for guaranteed future upside-
> Reduced coin supply should boost demand and price
>
> During price increases (\>\$1):\
> - New coins go to bondholders first (FIFO order)\
> - Remaining new coins go to shareholders\
> - Arbitrageurs can profit by selling into the expansion
>
> In theory, this creates strong incentives to maintain the peg. Bond
> buyers get guaranteed profit when price recovers, while share holders
> benefit from long-term growth. It\'s like an algorithmic central bank
> conducting open market operations.
>
> However, I identified several fatal flaws in this design:
>
> 1\. The 5-year bond expiration creates dangerous cliffs. If price
> stays below peg for extended periods, bonds start expiring worthless,
> destroying confidence.
>
> 2\. Bonds aren\'t fungible since their value depends on position in
> the redemption queue. This makes them harder to trade and reduces
> their effectiveness as stability mechanisms.
>
> 3\. There\'s a circular dependency in the incentives - people only buy
> bonds if they believe in future growth, but growth requires people to
> buy bonds. It\'s turtles all the way down!
>
> 4\. The system assumes perpetual growth to work. Like a government
> running on debt, it needs continuous expansion to pay past
> obligations.

> \## A Better Approach: FRAX\'s Fractional-Algorithmic Design

> After seeing pure algorithmic approaches fail, I was particularly

> algorithmically reduces the collateral ratio based on market demand.
>
> The key innovation is the concept of a market-driven collateral ratio.

>
> The protocol automatically adjusts this ratio based on market
> confidence:- Price above peg? Collateral ratio decreases\
> - Price below peg? Collateral ratio increases\
> - Ratio changes are gradual and algorithmic
>
> This creates a beautiful feedback loop:\
> 1. Market confidence increases →Collateral requirements decrease 2.
> Lower collateral requirements →More capital efficient\

> 1\. FRAX showed volatility levels comparable to fully-collateralized
> stablecoins despite much lower collateral requirements\
> 2. Failed algorithmic stablecoins like Basis and Ampleforth showed
> significantly higher volatility 3. FRAX\'s price movements were more

> FRAX shows this is possible by:\

> first truly inflation-resistant digital currency.

> The search for perfect digital money continues, but we\'re getting
> closer. By learning from past failures and embracing progressive
> decentralization, truly algorithmic stablecoins are within reach.

> The key lessons:\
> 1. Trust must be earned, not assumed
>
> 2\. Game theory isn\'t enough - you need real utility\
> 3. Evolution beats revolution\
> 4. Collateral training wheels help, if you have a plan to remove them

> The dawn of algorithmic money isn\'t a matter of if, but when and how.
> And that\'s incredibly exciting.
