## Why Are They The Best Approximation to Ideal Money?

The quest for ideal money has plagued economists for centuries. Drawing from John Nash's work on ideal money and Friedrich Hayek's theory of competing currencies, I argue that algorithmic stablecoins represent our best shot at creating truly ideal digital money.

To understand why, we need to evaluate different approaches against the three core functions of money across multiple time horizons:

1. **Unit of Account** - Consistent value measurement
2. **Store of Value** - Reliable wealth preservation  
3. **Medium of Exchange** - Efficient transaction capability

Through systematic elimination:
- **Bitcoin/ETH**: Excellent decentralization but volatility destroys their utility as everyday money
- **Fiat-backed stablecoins (USDC)**: Stable but require trust in traditional banking, defeating crypto's purpose
- **Crypto-collateralized stablecoins (DAI)**: Capital inefficient, requiring 150%+ collateralization
- **Commodity-backed stablecoins**: Hard to scale globally, tend toward centralization
- **Algorithmic stablecoins**: Potentially stable, infinitely scalable, and truly decentralized

Algorithmic stablecoins uniquely solve the trilemma of achieving stability, decentralization, and capital efficiency simultaneously. They represent the closest approximation to Nash's ideal money - a currency that maintains purchasing power without government control.

## Algorithmic Stablecoins Are Difficult To Build!

Algorithmic stablecoins combine monetary supply mechanics with embedded economic incentives for artificially controlling price. There's no enforcing agent, but dynamic interaction of agents, tokens, oracles, and deleveraging algorithms using incentive structures from game theory to maintain the peg. To develop price stability, algorithmic stablecoins use expansion and contraction of supply - essentially an algorithmic central bank that increases token supply when price rises above peg and reduces supply when price falls below.

There are numerous trials claiming it's possible to build non-collateralized, capital efficient, scalable, and self-sustaining currency. However, most implementations have failed to hold their peg and reach widespread adoption. Complexity arises from the fact that algorithmic stablecoins require a delicate balance of incentives distributed between participants and the maintaining algorithm.

## What's So Hard About Building A Non-Collateralized Algorithmic Stablecoin?

### 1. Incredible difficulty in guaranteeing stability

The stablecoin's stabilizing algorithms only take effect through incentives – not enforcement. Rules based solely on incentives make the system a delicate game theoretical balancing act with unforeseen circumstances and failures.

When stablecoins trade above peg, minting more tokens dissolves the uprise. The real problem occurs when tokens trade below peg - where algorithmic implementations differ. A slight imbalance immediately results in downward spirals. This problem is aggravated by lack of redeemable assets. With critical mass losing confidence, the token enters a bottomless spiral.

### 2. Building enough Lindy Effect to solidify long term stability

The Lindy Law states that future life expectancy of "non-perishable" items is proportional to their age. The longer something has survived, the higher likelihood of continued existence. For money, this translates to network effects and trust.

For stablecoins, consistent usage demand creates higher likelihood of maintaining peg. Most algorithmic designs underestimate the need for utility beyond speculation. Regardless of incentives, without systemwide Lindy effects, required incentives to maintain stability keep rising until reaching a tipping point.

Creating Lindy Effect involves:
- Facilitating fiat-crypto trading as temporary value storage
- Becoming denominating currency within DAOs
- Being added to reserve currency baskets
- Eventually becoming optimal money for transactions

```

### 3. Mitigating the Paradox of Stability

Adoption depends on early believers in algorithmic ideal money. However, belief alone doesn't guarantee onboarding. Rapid sentiment swings require strong initial incentives to prove anti-fragility – what I call "Ponzinomics."

Ponzinomics is the alchemy of combining assets with right incentives to maintain sufficient aligned interests for peg maintenance. Think of it as the "trampoline effect" for reaching mass adoption. This is done through arbitrage opportunities rewarding participants who stabilize the peg.

The Paradox of Stability: To achieve price stability, an algorithmic stablecoin must reach market cap large enough that individual orders don't cause fluctuations. However, purely algorithmic stablecoins can only grow through speculation and reflexivity. The problem with reflexive growth is unsustainability - contraction is equally reflexive. Hence the paradox: larger network value means more resilience, yet only highly-reflexive stablecoins prone to extreme cycles can reach large valuations initially.

## Building Blocks Of Algorithmic Stablecoins: An Empirical Analysis

With the notion of building ideal stablecoins in mind, two seminal papers emerged in 2014: Ferdinando Ametrano's "Hayek Money: The Cryptocurrency Price Stability Solution," and Robert Sams' "A Note on Cryptocurrency Stabilization: Seigniorage Shares". These papers highlight different approaches to non-collateralized algorithmic stablecoins.

### "Hayek Money: The Cryptocurrency Price Stability Solution" by Ferdinando Ametrano

Ametrano's paper proposes a rule-based supply-elastic currency building on Hayek's theory. The design counteracts price instability through automatic non-discretionary supply adjustment, aiming to keep purchasing power constant.

The mechanics involve distributing monetary base increments pro-quota to every wallet, without unfair wealth distribution. Percentage ownership remains constant while token quantities fluctuate to maintain peg price. This "rebasing" should occur at least daily to avoid huge swings.

Example with Amenti Coins (AC):
- Day 1: USD/AC parity observed, rebasing index = 1.00
- Day 2: USD/AC closes at 1.04 (+4% change)
- Rebasing multiplier: 1.00 × 1.04 = 1.04
- Result: Each wallet gets 1.04× their initial AC count
- Outcome: While USD/AC opened at 1.04, USD/RAC (rebased AC) opens at 1.00

For expansion (price doubles):
- Before: 10 coins × $1 = $10 value
- After: 20 coins × $0.5 = $10 value
- Wallet value unchanged, just more tokens

For contraction (price halves):
- Before: 10 coins × $1 = $10 value  
- After: 5 coins × $2 = $10 value
- Wallet value unchanged, just fewer tokens

```

│ Total: $50      │         │ Total: $50      │
└─────────────────┘         └─────────────────┘

Key: Token quantity changes, but total value remains constant
```

### Robert Sams' "A Note on Cryptocurrency Stabilization: Seigniorage Shares"

Sams argues that percentage change in coin price followed by same percentage change in supply returns price to initial value. His solution uses two token types: "coins that act like money and coins that act like shares in the system's seigniorage."

The mechanism:
- Price above peg: Issue new stablecoins to shareholders
- Price below peg: Sell bonds at discount to contract supply
- Bonds later redeemable for stablecoins when price recovers

Key innovation is using seigniorage shares to absorb volatility. Shareholders benefit from long-term growth while bond buyers arbitrage short-term deviations. The system assumes perpetual growth - if stablecoin market cap reaches $10B, shareholders earn $10B.

## Real World Protocol Implementation: A Breakdown

### Amentrano's Theory Implemented - Ampleforth Protocol

Ampleforth implements Ametrano's rebasing method, altering coin quantities simultaneously across all wallets to maintain stability. The system expands/contracts based on deterministic rules using daily time-weighted average price (TWAP) of AMPL targeted at $1.

Following Ametrano's fairness principles, everyone gets proportional tokens when price is high (creating sell pressure) and loses tokens when price is low (creating buy pressure). Profit-seeking traders restore equilibrium.

Game theoretical analysis reveals:

**During Expansion (Price > $1):**
- Buyers face disincentive: More tokens mean smaller percentage of total supply
- Sellers face incentive: More tokens to sell at elevated price
- Result: Selling pressure pushes price down

**During Contraction (Price < $1):**
- Buyers face incentive: Fewer tokens mean larger percentage of total supply
- Sellers face disincentive: Leaving means selling at discount
- Result: Buying pressure pushes price up

```
Game Theory Payoff Matrix for Ampleforth:

                    Market Price > $1 (Expansion)
                    ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐

    │ Other         │ No change   │ Price drops │
    │ Traders       │             │ toward peg  │
    └───────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘

                    Market Price < $1 (Contraction)
                    ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
                    │    Buy      │    Hold     │
    ┌───────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
    │ Rational      │ +20% gain   │ Miss profit │
    │ Trader        │ (optimal)   │ opportunity │
    ├───────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
    │ Other         │ Price rises │ No change   │
    │ Traders       │ toward peg  │             │
    └───────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘

Nash Equilibrium: Sell during expansion, Buy during contraction
```

The feedback loop creates habituation:
- Inflation becomes signal to sell
- Deflation becomes signal to buy
- Competition intensifies until convergence

Ampleforth's evolution phases:
1. **Store of Value**: High volatility, n-day convergence where n > 1
2. **Unit of Account**: Stable price, volatile supply
3. **Medium of Exchange**: Traders pre-empt rebases, achieving true stability

```

$0.90 ┤

Key: As traders habituate, volatility decreases and 
     convergence time approaches zero
```

The fatal flaw? Rebasing doesn't create real stability. If I have 100 AMPL worth $100 total, and after contraction have 90 AMPL still worth $100 total, my purchasing power for a $100 item remains unchanged. But the psychological effect of "losing tokens" creates panic selling, breaking the theoretical equilibrium.

### Sams' Theory Implemented - Basis Protocol

Basis implemented Sams' three-token system:
1. **Basis Coins** - The $1 stablecoin
2. **Basis Bonds** - Debt instruments sold when price < $1
3. **Basis Shares** - Equity receiving new coin issuance

The mechanism:
- Price < $1: Protocol auctions bonds for coins, burning coins to contract supply
- Price > $1: Protocol mints new coins, paying bondholders first (FIFO), then shareholders
- Bonds expire after 5 years if unredeemed

Game theory during contractions:
- Bond buyers bet on future recovery for guaranteed profit
- Coin holders sell into bond auctions
- Supply contracts until equilibrium

Game theory during expansions:
- Bondholders get paid first in order of purchase
- Shareholders receive remaining new issuance
- Arbitrageurs sell new coins to restore peg

Critical flaws identified:
1. **Bond expiration cliffs**: 5-year expiration creates confidence crises
2. **Non-fungible bonds**: Queue position affects value, reducing liquidity
3. **Death spiral risk**: Extended contractions lead to bond defaults
4. **Perpetual growth assumption**: Requires endless expansion to pay obligations

```
Basis Death Spiral Visualization:

Normal Operation:
Price: $1.00 → $0.90 → $1.10 → $1.00
Bonds:  0    →  100  →   0   →   0
Supply: 1M   → 900K  → 1.1M  →  1M
Status: ✓ Stable cycle

Death Spiral Scenario:
Price: $1.00 → $0.80 → $0.60 → $0.40 → $0.20
Bonds:  0    → 200K  → 500K  → 900K  → 1.5M
Supply: 1M   → 800K  → 500K  → 100K  →  0
Status: ✗ Unrecoverable

Key Problems:
- Bond queue grows exponentially
- Confidence collapses
- No buyers for new bonds
- Protocol fails
```

While Basis shut down citing regulatory concerns, these fundamental economic flaws would have likely caused failure regardless.

## The Path Forward: FRAX's Fractional-Algorithmic Innovation

Learning from pure algorithmic failures, FRAX pioneered a fractional-algorithmic approach. Instead of starting at 0% collateral, FRAX began at 100% and algorithmically reduces the ratio based on market confidence.

Key mechanisms:
- **Dynamic Collateral Ratio (CR)**: Currently ~85%, meaning $0.85 USDC backs each FRAX
- **Algorithmic Monetary Policy**: CR decreases when demand exceeds supply, increases during contractions
- **Dual Token System**: FRAX (stablecoin) and FXS (governance/volatility absorption)

To mint 1 FRAX when CR = 85%:
- Deposit $0.85 USDC
- Burn $0.15 worth of FXS
- Receive 1 FRAX

To redeem 1 FRAX:
- Burn 1 FRAX
- Receive $0.85 USDC
- Receive $0.15 worth of newly minted FXS

This creates robust arbitrage loops:
- FRAX > $1: Mint FRAX, sell for profit
- FRAX < $1: Buy FRAX, redeem for profit

```

                          Profit: $0.01 per FRAX
```

The genius is progressive decentralization. As confidence grows, collateral requirements decrease, eventually reaching true algorithmic status. Unlike Basis's perpetual growth assumption, FRAX can handle contractions by increasing collateral.

## Conclusion: Evolution Over Revolution

Non-collateralized algorithmic stablecoins are possible, but require evolutionary paths rather than revolutionary leaps. Money is fundamentally about trust - the dollar evolved from gold-backing as confidence grew. Similarly, algorithmic stablecoins must earn trust before removing collateral.

Key insights from this research:
1. **Trust Cannot Be Coded**: Game theory alone fails without real utility and confidence
2. **Collateral Bridges The Gap**: Fractional reserves allow progressive decentralization
3. **Simplicity Beats Complexity**: Convoluted mechanisms (Basis) fail where simple ones (FRAX) succeed
4. **Time Is The Ultimate Test**: Lindy effects matter more than clever incentives

The path forward involves:
- Starting with high collateral ratios
- Building real utility beyond speculation
- Gradually reducing collateral as confidence grows
- Maintaining transparency and aligned incentives

FRAX demonstrates this is achievable, currently exploring CPI-based stability beyond USD pegging. The dawn of truly algorithmic money isn't about if, but when and how we build sufficient trust to remove the last training wheels.

The future of money might not need governments or gold - just good game theory and patience.
