# Amenti Kenea

----
Currently sitting between engineering and our GTM team to built large enterprise deployments for [Decagon AI](https://decagon.ai).

Previously a founding engineer at [Didero AI](https://didero.ai), where we built systems to process tons of POs daily through AI agents that somehow handle procurement chaos better than humans.

In 2022-2024 I was learning how big tech actually works as a data scientist on the Core Ads team at Meta.

### 2018-2022: The Minerva Years
Attended [Minerva University](https://www.minerva.edu/) and lived/worked in San Francisco, Seoul, Hyderabad, Berlin, London

### Pre-2018
Born and raised in Addis Ababa. Spent high school convincing myself med school was the path, then discovered statistics and never looked back. 

### The Random Stuff

- Started a run club called [dontwalkinsoho](https://dontwalkinsoho.netlify.app/) because NYC needs more people sprinting through traffic
- Run an online radio station at [aava.club](https://aava.club/songs) putting up some songs I like everything from Ethiopian jazz to UK garage
- Write about stuff I like on this blog
