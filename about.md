Born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

Went to college in the US at [Minerva University](https://www.minerva.edu/) and lived/worked/studied in 7 countries across 4 continents. (SF, Seoul, Hyderabad, Berlin, London, Buenos Aires, Taipei)

Chronically online and love playing around with technology. I write my thoughts on that and other things like fashion, and music here.  

Previously managed to get an internship at [RaiseMe](https://www.raiseme.com/) during my freshman year, and worked with cofounder George Kirkland until they got acquired. I did some front end engineering at [Microsoft's](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) office360 team and realized I didn't like the repetitve task of trying to translate human language to computer language. After being bitten by the startup bug, I got conviced by [Inbae Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inbaelee/) to go work at [Kakao Ventures](https://www.kakao.vc/reference/old-home-2) focusing on African LP relations did some research of early stage ventures with [Contrary Capital](https://www.contrary.com/). After deciding to formalize my data science and stats professional skills, I went to Meta where I worked on Facebook Messenger -- and where I currently maintain the Ads Ecosystem as a Data Scientist.
