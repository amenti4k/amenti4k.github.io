### 2025 - Present: Building Autonomous AI Systems

Currently founding engineer at [Didero AI](https://didero.ai), where I discovered that [building autonomous systems is actually a distributed systems problem wearing an AI costume]([/2025/07/15/Building-on-Quicksand-The-Reality-of-Production-AI-Systems.html](https://amenti4k.github.io/ai/2025/07/15/Building-on-Quicksand-The-Reality-of-Production-AI-Systems.html)). We process tons of POs daily through AI agents that somehow handle procurement chaos better than humans.

### 2022-2024: Learning How Big Tech Actually Works

Joined Meta as a Data Scientist on the Core Ads team - basically the "data FBI" for $100B+ in annual revenue:
- Building anomaly detection for 140+ metrics (because someone needs to know when the money printer breaks)
- Leading the Thailand revenue investigation that prevented $1.76M/day from disappearing
- Learning that "executive reporting" means translating "the graph went down" into a 47-slide deck

Fun fact: Couldn't leave Meta until Oct 1, 2024 due to H1B restrictions. Freedom tastes good.

### 2018-2022: The Minerva Years

Attended [Minerva University](https://www.minerva.edu/):
- **San Francisco** 
- **Seoul** 
- **Hyderabad**
- **Berlin**
- **London**

### Pre-2018: The Ethiopian Times

Born and raised in Addis Ababa. Spent high school convincing myself med school was the path, then discovered statistics and never looked back. 

### The Random Stuff

- Started a run club called [dontwalkinsoho](https://dontwalkinsoho.netlify.app/) because NYC needs more people sprinting through traffic
- Run an online radio station at [aava.club](https://aava.club/songs) putting up some songs I like everything from Ethiopian jazz to UK garage
- Write about [being less stressed about claude code](/2025/07/03/Real-Guide-to-Claude-Code.html), fashion, and why your [SQL queries don't need to suck](/2024/06/10/Robust-SQL-Query-Generator.html)

Currently figuring out what happens when you give AI tools instead of instructions. Turns out, it works better.
